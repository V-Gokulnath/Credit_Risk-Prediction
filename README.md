# Credit Risk Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Credit Risk Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants. The system predicts whether an applicant is a low-risk or high-risk borrower by analyzing financial and demographic attributes, helping financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions.
